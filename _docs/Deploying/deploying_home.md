# Getting Started

## Features

### User Interaction


On the right side of any page, you'll notice links to edit the page, or
open an issue. This ensures that any time you have a question or want to 
suggest or request a change, you can do so immediately and link directly
to the section of interest. The sections on the page also have permalinks so
you can link directly to them.
